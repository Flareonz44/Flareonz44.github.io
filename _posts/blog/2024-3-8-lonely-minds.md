Life is constant movement. You get up late, grab a coffee and run to the office. You do your daily chores, you fulfill your obligations. You go home. You're tired, you watch one more episode of that Netflix series and fall asleep. Repeat.

I forgot the weekends.

You wake up even later. You have a coffee with your friend, whom you haven't seen for a month or two. You do something else, take a walk, have an ice cream, watch a movie, I don't know, leisure things. Repeat.

Yes I know, life is not like that. But it is, more or less, the average life. We never stop to think. We live, we love, we lie, Alan Walker would say. Without thinking beyond. We stick to the instantaneous, to what we see and touch. There is no need to go beyond.

We are prisoners of the reality that surrounds us, we cannot go beyond it. Bullshit, we can. But people in general do not tend to do so. Boredom is something we detest by nature. It is the lack of activity, the lack of action. We are dynamic beings, not static. That's why we are trapped. Because we are always looking to move. If you are bored, you watch videos on tiktok until another activity comes up. Until you have to make dinner. Until your friend arrives (he's always late). Until you get seen at the doctor's office. As long as we are busy, we are safe from Boredom. Because boredom is an appointment with yourself.

The more you know, the more you realize you know nothing. So, it is easier to live in ignorance. The ignorant are stupid, they don't know how to act or respond, they don't explore, they don't do anything. The ignorant is an inert being. But they are happy in their ignorance. Plato, in his story of the cave, said that those who saw figures on the walls beat the philosopher, the only one who knows reality and knows that the figures are false. Because knowledge makes you more unhappy. I am not referring to the knowledge of a subject, I am not referring to mathematics or medicine. I mean the knowledge of reality. The notion of what or who we are. 

Go right now to the Instagram of the popular girl in your class. What do you see? Pictures of her on the beach, with friends, at a party, posing in different outfits, thousands of selfies in the mirror, filters, stories of her somewhere abroad, somewhere famous. Yes, that's the first thing you see. What do you see next? Lots of colors, lots of moods, lots of energy. And then? That she just lives her life, enjoys her life, complains about her ex-boyfriends, takes pictures of her cat. She doesn't stop moving. And that's her way of being and living. And that's fine.

But she can't get out of there. Nobody gets out of there. We all live life trying to achieve our goals, trying to achieve more, to become better, to learn something new. To finally get that dream job, to drive on the roads of America. To see the Aurora Borealis. We live day to day in a Virtual Machine, in a virtual environment created by the mind. In a network that involves many people. We live in life.

Leaving is not easy. Those of us who have left did so because something happened to our virtual machine. Something broke it. Something made it fail. And that's when we stopped. And by stopping, we are able to appreciate the bigger picture, to see beyond. Most people go to a psychologist, which is almost like taking the car in for repairs so it can run again. But sometimes, there are early breakages that are irreparable. And that makes you live almost constantly, outside the virtual machine.

Those who have only two friends in their contact list. Those who don't talk much. Those who are not where most people are. Those who were on the host machine, can no longer go back. They can try to forget it, but the truth will always remain. Those who at parties stay on the sidelines. Those who have seen their bricks fall, their barriers go down, those who once thought of simply turning off the host machine, are the ones who can see further than everyone else. They are the ones who can see things unseen. They are the ones who can see things that do not exist. Those who build their world to feel some control. Those people can surprise you. Those unstoppable minds. Those lonely minds.
