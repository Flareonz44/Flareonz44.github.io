***This is my current game development proyect, and since it isn't finished, everything could change, but as for today, this is all the information I can provide ;)***

## Story

I plan this game to be a narrative-driven game with some kind of freedom to the player. It will be a mix between some psycho-horror (thanks [SOMA](https://store.steampowered.com/app/282140/SOMA/)) and some semi-survival characteristics. Some friends told me it is a bit ambitious, but I'm up for the challenge.

It is about an 'astronaut' whose mission is to explore Mars in search of life signs, but thing went terribly wrong and everithing takes a dark turn to an introspective journey in search of the essence of human-kind and what exactly means to exist.

## Technical aspect

This will be a 3D game written in C using Raylib. The gameplay will feature a procedurally generated terrain created with my own algorithm, based on Perlin noise generation. It will be almost infinity since it's limited to match the actual scale of the real planet's surface. Yes, it's vast, but don't worry; I'm planning to make the gameplay as dynamic as possible, even in a story-driven context.

## Stay updated

Despite the many demands in my life, I promise to share regular updates related to the game on my [social media](https://linktr.ee/flareonz44) platforms. So, stay tuned for the latest developments!
